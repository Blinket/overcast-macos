## Why?

* Use your keyboard's media keys (play/pause/skip/prev)
* Alt-tab your way to Overcast, instead of using a browser tab
* Remembers your state, so you can pick up where you left off

## Ideas?

*Please note: as this is a free application, I have not paid for the $150 Apple Developer Program to sign it. This means you will get an "Unidentified Developer" warning from macOS's Gatekeeper. [Go here to open the app regardless](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25088?locale=en_US)*
